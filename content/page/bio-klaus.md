### About me

Klaus Miller joined the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration at Goethe University in Fall 2015, as an Assistant Professor of Quantitative Marketing.

His research interests meet at the interface of empirical quantitative marketing, management economics, and information systems. Specifically, his research is concerned with pricing and advertising issues in two-sided markets, foremost the digital economy. Methodically, Klaus Miller´s research is based on quantitative empirical modeling, applied econometrics, distributed statistical computing, causal machine learning, as well as large-scale lab- and field-experiments. His research has been published in top-tier academic journals (e.g., the Journal of Marketing Research, the International Journal of Research in Marketing, and the Journal of Product Innovation Management) as well as management-oriented journals (e.g., Marketing Review St. Gallen, GFK Marketing Intelligence Review). In Frankfurt he currently teaches courses on Pricing and Data Science & Business Analytics.
