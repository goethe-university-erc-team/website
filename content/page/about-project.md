Cookies enable companies to collect information about users on the Internet. This information is also used to increase the revenue from online advertising that websites need in order to continue to be usable free of charge. However, collecting information restricts the privacy of users. The EU therefore limits the use of cookies (e.g. via the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the planned ePrivacy Regulation).

So far, there is very little empirical knowledge about the value of cookies for advertisers. It is therefore difficult for politicians to weigh up whether the restrictions on cookies in the interest of privacy are not accompanied by high losses for companies whose promotion is also a political objective. The research project COOKIES (Economic Consequences of Restrictions on the Usage of Cookies) by Prof. Bernd Skiera aims to close this knowledge gap.
