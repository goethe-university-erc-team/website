### Economic Consequences of Restrictions on the Usage of Cookies

Cookies (or “HTTP cookies”) enable companies to collect and exchange extensive information about users. This information is often used to improve the performance of online advertising, which website publishers rely on in order to finance the “free” content to which their users have become accustomed. Yet, the collection of information leads to a loss of privacy. Accordingly, EU policy makers have put forward initiatives to restrict cookie usage (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), upcoming ePrivacy Regulation).

So far, there exists very little empirical knowledge on the trade-off between user privacy and the economic value that website publishers, advertisers, and even users derive from cookies. As a result, policy makers have no way of telling whether their restrictions on cookies have the intended positive consequences for user privacy, or whether any benefits are outweighed by negative effects on the profits of companies—which policy makers also seek to nurture.

The vision of the ERC Investigator Grant is to eliminate the gap in knowledge regarding the economic consequences of restrictions on the usage of cookies.
